=head1 NAME

Crypt::DRBG::HMAC - Fast, cryptographically secure PRNG

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Crypt::DRBG::HMAC;

	my $drbg = Crypt::DRBG::HMAC->new(auto => 1);
	my $data = $drbg->generate(42);
	... # do something with your 42 bytes here

	my $drbg2 = Crypt::DRBG::HMAC->new(seed => "my very secret seed");
	my $data2 = $drbg->generate(42);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Crypt::DRBG::HMAC is an implementation of the HMAC_DRBG from NIST SP800-90A.  It
is a fast, cryptographically secure PRNG.  By default, it uses HMAC-SHA-512.

However, if provided a seed, it will produce the same sequence of bytes I<if
called the same way each time>.  This makes it useful for simulations that
require good but repeatable random numbers.

Note, however, that due to the way the DRBGs are designed, making a single
request and making multiple requests for the same number of bytes will result in
different data.  For example, two 16-byte requests will not produce the same
values as one 32-byte request.

This class derives from Crypt::DRBG, which provides several utility functions.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 Crypt::DRBG::HMAC->new(%params)

Creates a new Crypt::DRBG::HMAC.

%params can contain all valid values for Crypt::DRBG::initialize, plus the
following.

=over 4

=item algo

The algorithm to use for generating bytes.  The default is "512", for
HMAC-SHA-512.  This provides optimal performance for 64-bit machines.

If Perl (and hence Digest::SHA) was built with a compiler lacking 64-bit integer
support, use "256" here.  "256" may also provide better performance for 32-bit
machines.

=item func

If you would like to use a different hash function, you can specify a function
implemeting HMAC for your specific algorithm.  The function should take two
arguments, the value and the key, in that order.

For example, if you had C<Digest::BLAKE2> and C<Digest::HMAC> installed, you
could do the following to use BLAKE2b:

	my $func = sub {
		return Digest::HMAC::hmac(@_, \&Digest::BLAKEx::blake2b, 128);
	};
	my $drbg = Crypt::DRBG::HMAC->new(auto => 1, func => $func;
	my $data = $drbg->generate(42);

Note that the algo parameter is still required, explicitly or implicitly, in
order to know how large a seed to use.

=head2 $drbg->generate($bytes, $additional_data)

Generate and return $bytes bytes.  $bytes cannot exceed 2^16.

If $additional_data is specified, add this additional data to the DRBG.
